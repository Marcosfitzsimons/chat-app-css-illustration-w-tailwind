### I only used TailwindCSS, a bit of animate.css & vite build tool.

### Comments:
### I only had one problem linking my custom css variables to the tailwind syntax. I was able to fix it by following the official documentation:
        https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables
        
### Small animation with animate.css:
        https://animate.style/
        
### Conclusions: 
        I found tailwind to be a powerful tool for interface development.
        It will be a matter of practice to get familiar with tailwind syntax.
