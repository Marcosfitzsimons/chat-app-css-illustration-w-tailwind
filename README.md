### Comments:
### I only had one problem linking my custom css variables to the tailwind functionality. I was able to fix it by following the official documentation:
        https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#using-css-variables

### Conclusion: 
        I found tailwind to be a powerful tool for interface development.
        It will be a matter of practice to get familiar with tailwind
